    <h1>Callbacks, Promise & Asynchronous</h1>

    <h3>Sync in js</h3>

    <p>Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instructions waits for the previous instructions to complete its executions.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Asynchronous</h3>
    <p>Due to Synchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allow to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.</p>
    

    <hr>

    <h3>Callbacks</h3>
    <p>A Callbacks is a function passed as an argument to another function.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Callback Hell</h3>
    <p>Callback Hell : Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid of DOOM)</p>

    <p>This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.</p>

    <h3>Promises</h3>
    <p>Promise is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an object in jS.
        <br>
        It is a solution to callback hell.
    </p>

    <p>let promise = new Promise ((resolve, reject) => {.....})
        <br>
       ** function with 2 handlers : resolve or reject
        <br>
       ** resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JS
    </p> 

    <ul>A javascript promise object can be : </ul>
    <li>Pending : the result is undefined.</li>
    <li>Resolved : The result is a value(fullfiled)..... resolve (result) </li>
    <li>Rejected : The result is an error object.... reject (error) </li>


    <li>Promise has state (pending, fullfilled) & some result (result for resolve & error for reject).</li>

    <br>

    <ol>Promise has two state : </ol>
    <li>.then() & .catch()</li>
    <li>promise.then((res) => {} )</li>
    <li>promise.catch((err) => {} )</li>
